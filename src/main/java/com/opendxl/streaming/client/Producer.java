/**
 * <p>The {@link Producer} interface only exposes the {@link Channel} methods to produce records. It does not expose
 * methods to consume records. Objects complying with {@link Producer} interface are instantiated using
 * {@link ProducerBuilder} which implements a build pattern for {@link Producer}.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link Producer} is easier to use than {@link Channel} when you only need to produce records and not to consume
 * them. Benefits are:</p>
 * - a simplified instance creation because it is not necessary to provide parameters required by {@link Channel}
 *   consume operations (e.g.: consumerGroup, consumerPathPrefix, extraConfigs)
 * - a slim set of operations to produce only. Consume operations are not exposed, then it is not possible to call them
 *   by accident.

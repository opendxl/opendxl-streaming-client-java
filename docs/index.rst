OpenDXL Streaming Java Client Library
=====================================

See the navigation bar on the right for an overview of the OpenDXL Streaming
Java Client Library and examples.

Overview
--------
The OpenDXL Streaming Java client library is used to consume records
from as well as to produce records to a `Data Exchange Layer <http://www.mcafee.com/us/solutions/data-exchange-layer.aspx>`_
(DXL) Streaming Service.

The DXL Streaming Service exposes a REST-based API that communicates
with a back-end streaming platform. The streaming service
performs authentication and authorization and exposes methods to retrieve records
and to send them.

One concrete example of a DXL Streaming Service is the `McAfee MVISION EDR <https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/products/investigator.html>`_ "Events feed".
